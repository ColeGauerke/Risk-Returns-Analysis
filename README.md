# Risk-Returns-Analysis
This is a python program that will take in any number of desired stock symbols, download the data, and produce two graphs.
The first graph is a simple line graph that comapres teh percentage change of the mean returns from the closing price of every stock at the end of the day from the desired time period
The second graph comapres the Annual Returns(mean) vs. the Risk(standard deviation)
The program operates better in Jupyter Notebooks where it was designed but can operate in a python IDE as well
If you choose to operate in a Jupyter Notebook you can simply type in the commands and execute them segment by segment and the ouputs will be the same
